Function modification and runtime impact (Task 4 and 5)
Yes, it will slightly increase the runtime because an extra operation y = i + j is added to each iteration. However, this is still a constant-time operation, so the overall time complexity remains O(n²). The actual runtime will increase, but the growth rate will not change.

No, the results from #1 are based on the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm, and since adding y = i + j is just an additional constant-time operation, it does not change the time complexity from O(n²).
